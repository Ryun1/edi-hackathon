--------------------

This event is an opportunity for the community to actively participate in the  tooling that is being created for wallets and voting to implement on-chain voting. The primary goal is to work alongside wallet providers on their approach to Cardano‚Äôs age of Voltaire. This will be achieved by providing a physical space for close collaboration on the finalization of CIP-95‚Äôs design whilst also facilitating online participation in order to move the CIP process forward. Here the community can work side-by-side with wallet providers to efficiently achieve technically sound solutions to the problems of interfacing with Cardano‚Äôs new on-chain voting features.

The [CIP-95](https://github.com/Ryun1/CIPs/blob/governance-wallet-connector/CIP-0095/README.md) standard extends the [CIP-30 | Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0030/README.md) to provide support for [CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-1694/README.md4) focussed web-based stacks. Implementing CIP-95 wallets will allow the ability to interface with CIP-1694 tooling.

This hackathon will take place both online and in person to maximize the impact and ensure the desired outcomes. Discord will be used to enable anyone to join.
