# Age of Voltaire Wallets and Tooling Hackathon

This event is an opportunity to align the community on tooling that is being created by the Voltaire team and where the community can fit in. The primary goal is to work alongside wallet providers to work on their approach to Cardano‚Äôs age of Voltaire. This will be achieved by providing a physical space for close collaboration on the finalization of CIP-95 design whilst also facilitating online participation. Thus moving the proposal along in the CIP process. Here the IOG Voltaire team can work side-by-side with community wallet providers to efficiently achieve technically sound solutions to the problems of interfacing with Cardano‚Äôs age of Voltaire.

The CIP-95 standard extends the CIP-30 | Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge to provide support for CIP-1694 focussed web-based stacks. By implementing CIP-95 wallets will be able to interface with CIP-1694 tooling.

We plan to host this hackathon hybrid online and in person event to be able to maximize the impact and ensure the desired outcomes. Discord will be used to enable anyone to join.
